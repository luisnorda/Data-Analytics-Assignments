VBA Challange

    TA's Angel and Megan assisted me:

        Megan: assisted with my initial VBA code when creating a new colum for the ticker names, specifically with deleting duplicates.

        Angel: Assisted when tring to calculate the percentge change, specifically with holding that 'opening price' for a company as the code iterated to find when tickers duplicated. 


    I receive the idea to: 
    
        - 'Call' the Subroutine through out multiple sheets:

        - Application.Screen Updating:

        - Application.Calculation:

    The "If Not '____' Is Nothing Then" came from various youtube videos and google searches.
